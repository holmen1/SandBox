=======================
Basic Triangle Creation
=======================

This example demonstrates the typical way you'd ingest data into a Triangle.
Data in tabular form in a pandas DataFrame is required.  At a minimum, columns
specifying origin and development, and a value must be present.  Note, you can
include more than one column as a list as well as any number of indices for
creating triangle subgroups.

In this example, we create a triangle object with triangles for each company
in the CAS Loss Reserve Database for Workers' Compensation.

import chainladder as cl
import pandas as pd

# Read in the data
lobs = 'wkcomp'
data = pd.read_csv(r'https://www.casact.org/research/reserve_data/wkcomp_pos.csv')
data = data[data['DevelopmentYear']<=1997]

# Create a triangle
triangle = cl.Triangle(
    data, origin='AccidentYear', development='DevelopmentYear',
    index=['GRNAME'], columns=['IncurLoss_D','CumPaidLoss_D','EarnedPremDIR_D'])

# Output
print('Raw data:')
print(data.head())
print()
print('Triangle summary:')
print(triangle)
print()
print('Aggregate Paid Triangle:')
print(triangle['CumPaidLoss_D'].sum())

# Plot data
triangle['CumPaidLoss_D'].sum().T.plot(
    marker='.', grid=True,
    title='CAS Loss Reserve Database: Workers Compensation').set(
    xlabel='Development Period', ylabel='Cumulative Paid Loss');
